Title: Budget home NAS performance analysis

Budget home NAS performance analysis
<|eot_id|>


<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
Introduce the topic
<|eot_id|>


<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
I decided to reuse some older hardware I had lying around to drive a NAS where we can store our media.  Music and movies make up a portion of our data but it’s the  photos which are are by far the most important to us.  And we have lots and lots of them.  I could have bought a NAS and populated it with drives but I wanted to go through the challenge of setting up Raid arrays by my self. This was I could use the server for things like running containers and other bits and pieces. No raid setup is a substitute for a good backup strategy.  I run a weekly job to transfer everything over from the server to another PC’s single drive and every 3 months I backup the pictures and documents to the cloud.  I’m willing to loose movies and videos should the array die along with the backup drive.

After setting it all up I noticed that the write speeds of the array were quite slow.  Looking around for articles and posts on various sites I was unable to find any concrete performance numbers from a setup similar to mine for comparison.  I did come across lots of server-grade setups but those were backed by hardware Raid controllers and/or used SSD caches.  My setup doesn’t use either, not does it really have to as I’m not looking at making it go faster. I just want to understand whether the numbers I am seeing are indeed the limit of what I can expect. 

Articles online discuss the theoretical speed as being the number of drives * the speed of a single drive, all divided by 2 because of Raid-10.  With my HDD drives this comes to 4 * 180 / 2 = 360MB/s . Yet, as shown by the benchmarks, I only able to get 200MB/s even with sequential writes.  Random writes are ~30% slower.

I’m also trying to justify an upgrade of our LAN to 10Gb and the performance output here will help me to make that decision. Based on my criteria I formulated the following 3 questions and this page is all about answering them:

    Am I getting all that I can from the drivers I’ve chosen?
    What sort of speeds can I expect to see?
    Based on the speeds, does it make sense to upgrade from 1Gb ethernet?
    How long will a full back up take
    can I edit photos and videos directly off of the NAS?

Firstly I’m going to run some artificial tests against all of my drives to get a baseline of what they can do.  I have a secondary SSD attached to my server and the boot drive is also an SSD. I’m going to run the benchmarks against all the drives, but will not run any other tests of the boot drive.  I will then compares the results against a practical test using ‘curl’ and ‘rsync’ to copy the test file between the array and the secondary SSD. All the drives are using SATA 6 ports on my motherboard.

<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
What is the practical usage scenario here?
<|eot_id|>

<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Practical usage

Now that I have a benchmark it’s time to run some tests using regular tools. My main use-case is to backup a few TBs of data from the NAS to a different box. The second use-case write hundreds of photos in the .raw format onto the NAS.  I’m going to run all the tests between the NAS drives and the PCI-e NVME as only one of those drives will easily out perform the entire raid.  Doing so will remove any IO bottleneck between the devices.  There is an added challenge with testing between  onboard SATA devices as the total SATA bandwidth on the mother board is not a sum of all the SATA ports combines. My mother board has 8xSATA6 and 2xSATA3 ports giving it a total theoretical speed of 54 Gbps (6.75 GB/s). It’s impossible to run all the drives at full speed to achieve that throughput, though I have never tried to find the max SATA bandwidth for my motherboard, I doubt that it will ever go over 16 Gbps (2 GB/s). I don’t have direct proof, but I’d surprised that a consumer chip-set can handle any more bandwidth.  After all, how many people run a 6-drive SSD RAID array on their consumer motherboard?

rsync

create a large test file using:

timelimit -t 180 -T 180 cat /dev/random > /mnt/nvme0/testfile

copy the test file make sure to start the copy from the nvme

read from raid

to NVME

Now we reverse direction and copy data from the RAID array.  Create another large test file on the RAID to make sure that you are not hitting the system cache.

Although the write speed for nvme0n1 shows 1542.88 MB/s, it’s not a constant value.  The entire transfer is quite spiky as the NVME cache is periodically written to the drives at high speed and then the speed drops to 0 as the cache is refilled.

From the synthetic tests and the cached write, we know that the Raid array is capable of faster writes. Inspecting the secondary SSD with
‘nmon’ reveals that it’s only being read from at 200MB/s which points to ‘rsync’ being the bottleneck.

testfile 
  5,368,709,120 100%; 189.69MB/s    0:00:26 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/1)

A re-run of the copy does not read from the SSD drive. Instead it uses the system cache. The write speed is in line with the expectationof 360MB/s, but I don’t think this is actually copying any data to the drive:

$ rsync --progress --stats ../workers/testfile testfile2
testfile 
  5,368,709,120 100% 353.88MB/s 0:00:14 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/1) 

transfer between SATA SSDs

quick test to see the speeds between the two SATA SSDs. The SATA SSDs I have here are not the best but I’d still expect them to pull a higher speed between them than what the RAID could achieve.

$ rsync --progress --stats ~/testfile .
testfile 
  5,368,709,120 100%  159.97MB/s    0:00:32 (xfr#1, to-chk=0/1)

This is an interesting result.  I don’t understand why the transfer between the two SSDs is so slow. It’s possible that the book device is actually running at 3Gbps instead of the 6Gb, but that result is only around 1.48Gbps. No idea here.

curl

Let’s give curl a whirl.  Curl doesn’t perform any logic when it comes to checking whether the data should be copied over or not. It simply does what it’s asked to do.

from SATA SSD

$ curl -o testfile FILE:///mnt/workers/testfile
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

$ curl -o testfile FILE:///mnt/storage/testfile
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

Explanation

Curl looks to be quicker than ‘rsync’ when it comes to writing to the Raid-10 array, while the read speeds remain similar.

mdadm sync

Output from mdadm sync:

$ cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid10] [linear] [multipath] [raid0] [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] 
md0 : active raid10 sde[1] sdd[0] sdg[4] sdf[2]

      bitmap: 0/59 pages [0KB], 65536KB chunk

unused devices: <none>

The speed of 189037K/s lines up with what we are getting from rsync.

Summary

‘rsync’, ‘curl’, ‘pv’ all seems to be quite slow at reading from the Raid-10 array for some reason. I can only get read speeds of about 200 MB/s using any of these tools.

There might be a bottleneck between the motherboard storage controllers which the drives are attached to.  The Raid-10 array is plugged into SATA 6 ports powered by the AsMedia controller, while the two SSDs are driven through the Intel controller.  To test this I’m going to plug in a PCI-E SATA 6 extension card and connect the secondary SSD to it. 

Conclusion

This wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be. The clearest part was that the synthetic tests were always going to produce better results than what you’d expect from real-file scenarios. I’m glad about two things:

    I now know what the limits of the Raid-10 array are
    My knowledge in the area of storage has improved

Clearly there is a huge difference in performance when it comes to the software you are using. Going from write speeds of 309MB/s in an artificial test, to 268 MB/s with curl down to 190MB/s with ‘rsync’ really proves that you have to understand your use case in order to choose the right hardware and follow that up with appropriate configuration. I believe my use cases are ‘ticked’ because I know how fast my array can read/write. When it comes to the right speed I just want to understand what is going on. The speeds I”m getting suite me just fine. It”s the understanding of why am I seeing what I am seeing that is important. Getting the most out of a product is satisfying especially from the point of view of an engineer.

What sort of speeds can I expect to see?

The writes are consistently around the 200MB/s mark with the ability to hit 300MB/s when utilizing multiple threads. The reads seem to be 180MB/s, which is a third of what the synthetic tests can do.

Am I getting all that I can from the drivers I’ve chosen?

No. The synthetic tests do get 600MB/s in reads but the apps I use cannot match that.  I tried running multiple copy jobs at the same time, but they all summed up to the read speed of 200 MB/s.  I doubt this configuration can go any faster.

Based on the speeds, does it make sense to upgrade from 1Gb ethernet?

No.  We rely on ‘rsync’ for the most part and it only reaches around 190MB/s on the writes which won’t exhaust 2.5Gb (312.5 MB/s). Windows copy might be able to make use of the extra bandwidth and come close to curl’s write speeds. We hardly ever read data at the same time from other devices. Since we cannot get anywhere near the 600MB/s read speeds we saw during the synthetic test, we can stay on 1Gb for the foreseeable future.

Possibilities for the future

Not all hope is lost however. There are lots of other things we can try, however most of them would require a rebuild of the array.  I’d would also love to try this out with some different drives which come with higher transfer speeds and bigger caches. Here is a short brain dump of what we can do to explore further:

    hardware raid to add a SSD drive as a cache – there are some experimental packages out there that can help with adding a SSD to ‘mdadm’ Raid arrays.
    a different file system
    a storage OS
    fiber optic LAN to get away from the presumed chipset bottleneck
    a different Raid setup. I did try Raid-5 initially but the sync took days so the drives were continuously spinning for days.
    the ”far layout”. Mine is ‘Layout : near=2’. For this I have to rebuild the array.
